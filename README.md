# Fun with the Python logging module

I created this repository as I was learning about some of the ins and outs of the Python logging module.
It includes:

- Accessing loggers from modules
- Log formatting
- Custom handlers
- Logging uncaught exceptions

As a bonus, I wrote a little decorator which times how long a task takes and logs the result.
(Actually, this probably makes more sense as a context manager; I have code somewhere which does that too.)
